This is a WIP for a Javascript client for the Checkvist API.  

If you just want to pull a single list or task out of Checkvist, you are
probably better doing it yourself, but if you want a more full-featured
client, this may help.

See the html file for some examples.

TODO:

It needs tests and whatnot, but it seems to be mostly feature complete.

CAVEATS:

It does use require Cross-Origin XMLHttpRequest which in my case was fine since I am using it in a
webOS app so that works fine but 

You probably need to launch chrome with --disable-web-security or 
--allow-file-access-from-files for testing.
